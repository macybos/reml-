    "1. Please answer the following questions as part of your project proposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write your answers in the *Markdown* cells of the Jupyter notebook. You don't need to write any code, but if you want to, you may use the *Code* cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html) to print the *.ipynb* file as HTML. You will need to open the command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the file, and use the command: `quarto render filename.ipynb --to html`. Submit the HTML file.\n",

Of the columns we anticipate will be useful, there are 4 categorical variables, 66 continuous, and 3 columns that we think could be up for interpretation. These three columns are number of gas accounts, number of electricity accounts, and number of accounts with zero kWh usage for the year of 2010. We say these are up for interpretation because we can imagine cases when categorizing buildings into numbers of a certain account could provide useful information, but we can also see these variables being useful in a continuous sense, like finding the average number of accounts per building. \n",
